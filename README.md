# Investing-with-IA
This Machine Learning algorithm analises financial data and learn the best way to invest.

The algorithm takes the data from six companies listed on the brazilian stock marcket and use it to learn a profitable investment strategy.

It was made for a class called "Introduction to Controll and Automation Engeneering" from Santa Catarina Federal University.

It is a experimental project and shoudn't be used to actually make financial decisions.

In order to run it, just call the function "treinar()" and give it the number of generations as the argument.

The recomended number of generations is 1000, but the higher the number, the better tends to be the result.

WARNING depending on the number of generations, the code will take a couple of hours to complete.
